User Study:

Methodology:
The game begins by selecting a number (3, 5, 7) from a dropdown menu,
one to four different shapes from a list, and one to four different colors from a list.
The user then clicks the 'Submit' button to begin the game.

The user is presented with a series of question marks, one for each shape they will be guessing.
Under each question mark the user will select their guess for what shape is hidden above 
from a dropdown menu. After all guesses have been placed the user will click the 'Guess!' button.

For each correct guess the user will receive one point. The user can guess three times before
the game will end. The maximum score the user can receive is three times the number of shapes.
This is achieved by correctly guessing each shape on the first round, and submitting their guesses 
twice more to complete all three trials.

After all three trials are complete the 'Guess!' button will be disabled, the user will be presented
with their final score. They can then either close the game with the 'Close' button, or restart with
the 'Restart' button.
